# Azure Functions HTTP Trigger

This document describes the configuration for an Azure Functions HTTP Trigger, which defines how the function is triggered and how it responds to incoming requests.

## Configuration Overview

The configuration defines two components: the HTTP trigger and the HTTP output binding. The trigger specifies how the function is triggered, and the binding specifies how the function responds to incoming requests.

### HTTP Trigger

- **Type:** `httpTrigger`
- **Authentication Level:** `anonymous`
- **Direction:** `in`
- **Name:** `req`
- **HTTP Methods:** GET and POST

The HTTP trigger configuration specifies that the function should be triggered by incoming HTTP requests. It allows both GET and POST methods. The trigger is set to have an "anonymous" authentication level, meaning it does not require authentication to access.

### HTTP Output Binding

- **Type:** `http`
- **Direction:** `out`
- **Name:** `res`

The HTTP output binding configures how the function responds to incoming requests. The "res" binding represents the HTTP response, which is sent back to the client after the function execution. This binding is used to craft the response that the function returns to the client.

## Usage

This Azure Functions configuration is designed to work with an HTTP-triggered serverless function. The function can be invoked via HTTP GET and POST requests, and it responds to these requests without requiring authentication.

To use this configuration, you need to create an Azure Functions application and configure a function using this HTTP trigger and output binding. The function code should be designed to process the incoming requests and use the "res" binding to craft and send the response back to the client.

## Authentication

As specified in the configuration, this HTTP trigger is set to an "anonymous" authentication level. This means that clients can invoke the function without requiring any form of authentication. However, you can modify the authentication level to fit your specific security requirements.

# Go Web Server

A simple Go web server implemented in the provided code. The server handles HTTP requests and responds with either a "Hello, World" message for GET requests or echoes the request body for other HTTP methods.


## Code Overview

The Go web server is a basic HTTP server that listens on a specified port, which can be configured using an environment variable `FUNCTIONS_CUSTOMHANDLER_PORT` or defaults to port 8080.

The server has a single HTTP handler function, `helloHandler`, which responds to requests at the `/api/hello` endpoint. It distinguishes between GET and non-GET requests, responding differently for each case.

- For GET requests, it returns a simple "hello world" message.
- For non-GET requests (e.g., POST, PUT, etc.), it echoes the request body.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following sections:

1. Import Statements:
    - Import necessary packages, including `fmt`, `io/ioutil`, `log`, and `net/http`.

2. `helloHandler` Function:
    - The `helloHandler` function handles incoming HTTP requests and responses. It sets the `Content-Type` header to "application/json" and performs different actions based on the request method.
    - For GET requests, it responds with "hello world."
    - For other HTTP methods, it reads the request body and echoes it back.

3. `main` Function:
    - The `main` function is the entry point of the application. It sets up the HTTP server and configures the port based on the `FUNCTIONS_CUSTOMHANDLER_PORT` environment variable.
    - It creates an HTTP server using Go's `http.NewServeMux()` and registers the `helloHandler` for the `/api/hello` endpoint.
    - The server listens on the specified port and logs its status.

# Building and Testing Azure Functions Locally

To build and test an Azure Function locally using the `azure-functions-core-tools`. These tools allow you to develop, debug, and test your Azure Functions on your local development machine before deploying them to Azure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Azure Functions Core Tools**: Install the `azure-functions-core-tools` package by following the official documentation: [Azure Functions Core Tools Installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=linux%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-csharp).

- **Go Binary**: You should have a Go binary (compiled code) ready for your Azure Function. Ensure that your Go application is properly structured and can be executed.

## Building the Go Binary

To build the Go binary for your Azure Function:

1. Navigate to the directory where your Go code is located.

2. Build the Go binary using the `go build` command. For example, if your Go entry point is in a file named `main.go`, run:

   ```bash
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app main.go

## Running the Local Azure Functions Environment

To test your Azure Function locally, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where your Go binary (`function`) is located.

3. Use the `func start` command to run the local Azure Functions runtime:

   ```bash
   func start
This command starts the Azure Functions runtime locally, allowing you to invoke and test your function.

Your Azure Function will be hosted locally and should provide you with endpoint URLs. Note the URL for the function you want to test.

## Testing the Azure Function

Once the local Azure Functions environment is running, you can proceed to test your Azure Function:

1. **HTTP Client or Web Browser:** Use an HTTP client or web browser to make HTTP requests to the local Azure Function's endpoint. The URL will be in the form of `http://localhost:7071/api/{functionName}`.

2. **HTTP GET or POST Requests:** Send HTTP GET or POST requests as specified in your function's trigger configuration. Ensure that you provide any required input or data based on your function's design.

3. **Response Examination:** Examine the responses received from your Azure Function to ensure that it behaves as expected. This may involve checking for correct data, status codes, and any other expected outcomes.

By following these steps, you can thoroughly test your Azure Function within the local development environment to ensure it operates as intended before deployment.
